\section*{Reading guide}

The reader is highly recommended to have a PDF version of this master thesis available even though if the reader prefers a paper edition for reading the thesis. This is because links to web pages are used in the report. The most important link is to the \href{https://github.com/Kenil16/master\_project}{Github repository} where the code and videos of simulations and real flight of the UAV can be found. These links are labeled light blue in the text. Moreover, most of the illustrations, diagrams, tables and images used are implemented with very high resolution. This is done so that the reader can zoom in on important aspects of the used methods and results if wanted. Moreover, labels to all sections, figures, equations and tables will be labeled dark blue for easy access. Lastly, references will be labeled with a green color as \cite{masterThesis} where this is a reference to the mentioned GitHub repository.
