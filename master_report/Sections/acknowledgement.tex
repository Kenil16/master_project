\section*{Acknowledgement}

I would like to thank \href{https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/persons/henrik-skov-midtiby}{Henrik Skov Midtiby} for guidance throughout this master thesis where knowledge about robotics and especially computer vision has been at disposal in the implementation of the autonomous offboard control system for vision based navigation. Moreover, I will thank \href{https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/persons/jes-grydholdt-jepsen}{Jes Grydholdt Jepsen} for advice in the implementation of the PX4 autopilot as well as guidance with the OptiTrack system which has been a crucial part of analyzing the performance of the system for real flight of the UAV.
