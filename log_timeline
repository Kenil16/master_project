The day has been spend on litterature search. A number of articles were found which is going to be used in the related work section of the report.

PX4 has been installed. Moreover, a 3D model of the aruco markers has been made. However, the model could not be importet into Gazebo. A solution to this must be found. 12/09/2020:

The drone to be used in this project has been implemented as well as the optitrack world in Gazebo.

Arcuo marker detection has been finished where the correct pose from the drone to the marker has been found. Much time has been spend in getting this pose estimation to work proberly. 
This was due to the transformation matrices were not calculated correctly. The ROS method euler_from_matrix(T_drone_marker,'sxyz') was used instead of euler_from_matrix(T_drone_marker,'rxyz'). 
This caused the caulculations to be done wrongly. Also T_drone_camera = euler_matrix(-np.pi/2, np.pi/2,0,'rxyz') np.pi/2 was used instaed of 1.5 which also was a problem. 
Kalman Filters have been implemented for the pose. Maybe better choices of VAR could be found for even better tracking.
