Appraoch
This test was made to invastigate the precision of the aruco marker pose estimation. This was utilised by using the bottom camera 
of the drone from a altitude of 1, 1.5 and 3 meters. Here a resolution of 720*480 was used. Another test with an altitude of 
3 meters and 1280*720 was made to see the impact the reolution has in regard to the pose estimation of the marker. 

Analysis
The pose estimation was found to diviate auite a lot when the marker is far way. An altitude of 1-1.5 was proved to be enought
to have a decent pose estimation with an aruco board of 6 markers of width 0.1 and marker seperation of 0.02 meters. Also the 
resolution of the camera was important. The higther resolution the better pose estimation. But this comes with the expends of a lower FPS 
(frame per second) rate. With a 720*480 the FPS was approximatly 30-40 and 1280*720 approximatly 15-25. This can be seen in the images and 
grapths.
