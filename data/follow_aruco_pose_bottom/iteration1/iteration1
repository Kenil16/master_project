Approach
This test was made to test the initial idea of following the aruco marker pose by utilising the bottom camera. 
Here the default P position controller and PID velocity controller from PX4 has been used with default values. 
The drone has been regualrized with a maximum velocity of 0.2 meters in the xy direction to avoid unstable flight
and a smooth transition between markers.

Analysis
The drone follows the markers nicely without moving away from the target location. From the images it can be seen 
that the drone has quite a big error in the position for both x, y and z coordinate. Improvements has to be made 
to reduce this error. Also the flight time can be seen to be high. This is because the maximum velocity has been 
set to 0.2 m/s to avoid instabilitis. However, this also has to be improved to reduce the flight time significantly.
