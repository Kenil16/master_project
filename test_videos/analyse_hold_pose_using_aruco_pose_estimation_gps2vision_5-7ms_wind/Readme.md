## _Hold pose using the GPS2Vision ArUco marker board_

This test was conducted to investigate the abillity of the drone to hold its pose in front of the ArUco marker board (GPS2Vision board). The outcome of this would yield the performance of the control algorithms for pose control and conclude if further optimizations in pose control have to be performed. To stress test the implmentation, wind have been added in the simulation. 

The drone has to keep its pose approximatly 4 meters away from the GPS2Vision board with wind speeds between 5-7 m/s.
