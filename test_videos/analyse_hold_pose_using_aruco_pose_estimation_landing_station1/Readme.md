## _Hold pose using the landing station one ArUco marker board_

This test was conducted to investigate the abillity of the drone to hold its pose in front of the landing board one. The outcome of this would yield the performance of the control algorithms for pose control and conclude if further optimizations in pose control have to be performed.

The drone has to keep its pose approximatly 1 meter away from the ArUco marker board.
