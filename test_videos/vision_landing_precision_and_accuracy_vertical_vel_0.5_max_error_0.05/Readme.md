# Results from Gazebo from simulations
## _Vision based landing_

This test was conducted to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the vision based landings of the drone. All three landing stations will be used ramdomly to randomize the test. This will also give an indication of how much the number of ArUco markers in the image influences the stabillity of the drone and hence the abillity to achieve better precision landings.
