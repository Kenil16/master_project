# Results from Gazebo from simulations
## _Vision based navigation_

This test was conducted to evaluate the performance of the vision based navigation of the drone using ArUco markers. Here the pose estimation will compared to the ground truth of the drone to see how well the pose esimation performs when the drone is moving around in the simulated environment. 

In this case, the full 25 times 25 ArUco marker board is used using the bottom camera of the drone. The forward velocity is set to 1 m/s.
