A Schedule for jobs which have to be done 

* Do litterature search for state of the art methods of vison based navigation. Find methods, algortihms and solutions to relatetad topics. (DONE) (11/09-2020)(12/09-2020)

* Install PX4 simulation tools on the computer. The 3D models of the airport, optitrack system and drone must be included to be used in the project. (DONE) (12/09/2020)(20/09/2020)

* Install and setup ROS and Gazebo on the computer. (DONE) (31-08-2020)(31-08-2020)

* Analysis of different methods in regard to the solution of the method of object detection. (Pending) 

* Analyse STD and mean of GPS coordinates and error. This can be used to know when to disable or enable the use of GPS when approching or leaving the entry to the charging station. (Pending)
 - A way to simulate GPS noise in Gazebo must be found. (Pending)

* Analyse which camera setiings to use e.g angles of cameraes, numbers ( bottom or front cam or both) etc. Take also into account failures if markers dissapers in the view when using vision control as navigating the drone. (Pending)

* Invastigate if Trello could be used as a software management tool e.g for jobs, planning and schuduling of tasks throughtout the project. (Pending)
